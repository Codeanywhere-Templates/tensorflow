This is a template project for TensorFlow machine learning applications in [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/).
[Try it out](https://app.codeanywhere.com/#https://github.com/Codeanywhere-Templates/tensorflow)

## Features

- Development container for TensorFlow machine learning
- Pre-installed TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- Interactive Jupyter notebook environment
- Complete MNIST digit classification example

## Sample Project

The template includes a complete workflow for image classification using the MNIST digits dataset:

1. **Load and Prepare Data**: Import and normalize the MNIST dataset
2. **Build a Neural Network**: Create and understand a simple but effective neural network
3. **Train Your Model**: Run the training loop with visualization of progress
4. **Test and Evaluate**: See your model in action with test images
5. **Save and Load**: Learn how to persist your trained model
